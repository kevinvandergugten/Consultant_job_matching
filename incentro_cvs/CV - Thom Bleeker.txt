Thom Bleeker
Data Engineer with 6 years work experience 


Trained as an applied mathematician, he has all the knowledge to tackle (big) data issues. As a consultant, Thom finds out the business demand of the customer and translates this into clear and sharp analyses. In the different phases of the analysis process, he is constantly curious about ways to further optimize. Thom likes to seek collaboration with team members, in order to jointly arrive at new insights.


He has implemented predictive models at DPG Media, for example, and made the insights from these available to the organization.


Reliability and structure are core elements that Thom likes to apply in projects. Because smart insights are only possible if they are fed by a thorough data flow. Because he orchestrated these transformations and components to create a stable and maintenance-friendly data platform.


Thom is versatile. This is due to his experience as a data scientist, in which he is mainly concerned with collecting customer demand and translating it into solutions.
In addition, Thom works as a data engineer, which enables him to view and answer customer questions from a technical perspective. This combination makes Thom an enrichment for any team. Thom prefers to work according to the methodologies of scrum.

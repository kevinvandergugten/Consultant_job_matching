Work experience


Featured projects


2021
Graduation research @ Thales Netherlands
At Thales I was offered a great assignment that matched very well with the specialisation (Big Data & ML) of my training. Here the aim was to create a system that could process large data sets in a faster manner than the current system.


2019 - 2020
Mobile Development Internship @ Incentro
As an intern at Incentro, I was commissioned to make a lunch app for tracking and paying for lunches. During this internship I was able to orient myself well on the professional field and what exactly I like about software development. I found out that my interest lies mainly in the data processing part.


2020-2021
Backend Software Data Engineer @ NDIX
I joined the NDIX software team. Within the team we were working on creating a customer portal. My main function was engineering the backend, during which I spent a lot of time processing and implementing various APIs.

Educations


2017 - 2021
HBO-ICT (Software Engineering), BASc @ Saxion
During this study I was able to develop into a full-fledged Software Engineer. During the training I was able to specialise myself as a data engineer by delving into Big Data & Machine Learning.


2020
Computer Security, Minor @ Robert Gordon University
Saxion gave me a great opportunity to do a minor abroad. I like to be open to new challenges, so I took the minor Computer Security at the RGU in Aberdeen. Here I not only gained knowledge in the minor itself, but also in the experience of another culture.
